        <p class="intro" id="intro">This publication has stemmed from a mistake I made while printing the first publication. It created an overlay of images that were a lot more direct and telling than the initial strategy of printing them side by side. I took advantage of that mistake and pushed it even further applying four layers of images on top of each other.<br><br>Now these overplayed prints created completely new narratives that hit the perfect balance of being ambiguous yet still preserving some visible elements of the original images. All of the images were printed out and then printed again on top of each other using a copy machine which also gave me a distinct visual effect that transformed the images.</p>
