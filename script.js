    "These four posters are created from images of fists from different historical moments and geographical locations. They explore how the use of the symbol changed and evolved over time and reflect on the current connotation that it carries. The series is an attempt to clarify the symbol’s meaning after it has been distorted and diluted over more than a century, or rather an attempt to reflect on this uncertainty and find peace with it.<br><br>On each poster you can see four juxtaposed images from different times and places that have been sorted by their distance from the current moment (being Moscow, Russia, June of 2020) as well as their written descriptions.","This publication is a collection of the first 44 images that I’ve collected during my project. My entire process was centred around working with found imagery that includes the symbol of a clenched fist as a political sign. This is the first instance of me trying to make sense of the collection that I gathered. <br><br>The images were distributed randomly among the pages to figure out if combining graphics that belong in different times, countries and political movements would make them offset each other creating some sort of new narrative.","This publication is a collection of texts describing all 324 fist images that I used to create the posters. Some of the captions describe the image and some of them are titles or headlines, in the case of images such as posters or book covers. <br><br>For my project it was important to provide some clarification on the images I was working with since I used them not only as visual material but also as signifiers of specific events that happened from 1917 (which is the earliest dated image in the collection) up until 2020. The captions offer a new way to look at the taxonomy that I’ve created and allow the viewer to decipher or reconstruct the image by its description. This publication allows us to decide whether it is the visual of the clenched fist that creates the connotation of the image or if it's just an add-on to the message.", "This publication has stemmed from a mistake I made while printing the first publication. It created an overlay of images that were a lot more direct and telling than the initial strategy of printing them side by side. I took advantage of that mistake and pushed it even further applying four layers of images on top of each other.<br><br>Now these overplayed prints created completely new narratives that hit the perfect balance of being ambiguous yet still preserving some visible elements of the original images. All of the images were printed out and then printed again on top of each other using a copy machine which also gave me a distinct visual effect that transformed the images."]
