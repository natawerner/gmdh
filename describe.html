        <p class="intro" id="intro">These four posters are created from images of fists from different historical moments and geographical locations. They explore how the use of the symbol changed and evolved overtime and reflect on the current connotation that it carries. They are an attempt to clarify the symbolâ€™s meaning after it has been distorted and diluted over more than a century, or rather an attempt to reflect on this uncertainty and find peace with it.<br><br>On each poster you can see four juxtaposed images from different times and places that have been sorted by their distance from the current moment (being Moscow, Russia, June of 2020).</p>
