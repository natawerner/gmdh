        <p class="intro" id="intro">This publication is a collection of texts describing all 324 fist images that I used to create the posters. Some of the captions describe the image and some of them are titles or headlines, in the case of images such as posters or book covers. <br><br>For my project it was important to provide some clarification on the images I was working with since I used them not only as visual material but also as signifiers of specific events that happened from 1917 (which is the earliest dated image in the collection) up until 2020. The captions offer a new way to look at the taxonomy that I’ve created and allow the viewer to decipher or reconstruct the image by its description. This publication allows us to decide whether it is the visual of the clenched fist that creates the connotation of the image or if it's just an add-on to the message.</p>
