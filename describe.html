        <p class="intro" id="intro">This publication is a collection of texts describing all 324 fist images that were included in the final collection. Some of the captions describe the image and some of them are titles or headlines of such images as posters or book covers. <br><br>
For my project it was important to provide some explanation of the images I was working with, since I use them not only as visual material but also as signifiers of specific events that happened since 1917 (which is the earliest image I was working with) up until 2020. The captions offer a new way to look at the taxonomy that I’ve created and allows the viewer to decipher or reconstruct the image when it’s stripped of its visuals. This publications allows us decide whether it is the visuality of the clenched fist symbol that provides its connotation or if the image is just an add-on to the message.</p>
